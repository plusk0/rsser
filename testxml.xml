      <title>Trump administration's trust and credibility tested in wake of Pretti's death in Minneapolis</title>
      <link>https://www.france24.com/en/trump-administration-s-trust-and-credibility-tested-in-wake-of-pretti-s-death-in-minneapolis</link>
      <description>
Lawmakers are demanding a full federal and state investigation into the Minneapolis shooting of Alex Pretti, saying the credibility of ICE and DHS is at risk amid conflicting accounts. Federal officials initially portrayed Pretti as a violent instigator with a gun, but video footage shows him being pushed and subdued while holding only a phone. The incident has fueled concerns about transparency and trust in the administration, and Trump is under mounting pressure even from parts of his MAGA base as the controversy deepens, as FRANCE 24's Fraser Jackson explains.

      <title>Winter storm grips much of US in snow, ice, Arctic cold</title>
      <link>https://www.france24.com/en/winter-storm-grips-much-of-us-in-snow-ice-arctic-cold</link>
      <description>
A powerful winter storm spread heavy snow, sleet, and freezing rain across much of the eastern US, while Arctic cold gripped areas east of the Rockies. Winter storm warnings covered 118 million people, and the deep freeze strained energy supplies and caused widespread travel disruptions. About 157 million Americans were urged to stay warm as temperatures plunged from below zero near the Canadian border to below freezing as far south as the Gulf of Mexico. FRANCE 24's Jessica Le Masurier reports from New York.

      <title>EU and India sign trade deal, 15 years in the making, ushering in a 'multidimensional relationship'</title>
      <link>https://www.france24.com/en/video/20260127-eu-and-india-sign-trade-deal-15-years-in-the-making-ushering-in-a-multidimensional-relationship</link>
      <description>
Delano D'Souza welcomes Dr Chietigj Bajpaee, Senior Research fellow for South Asia in the Asia-Pacific Programme at Chatham House. The recently agreed EU–India trade deal represents a geopolitical and economic milestone. After 15 years of negotiations, the agreement aims to reduce tariffs on a wide array of goods, deepen economic ties, and broaden cooperation beyond trade into mobility and technology. All the while, politically sensitive sectors like agriculture were excluded and broader strategic tensions, especially India’s relationship with Russia, cast a dark shadow. At its core, this deal reflects longstanding partnership ambitions coupled with added pressures from global economic competition.
